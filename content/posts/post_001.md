The trainers in the drawer had been used once. They were an immaculate white colour with a central blue stripe across either side. Today they would get stained, today I felt empowered. I hauled myself out of my sofa, the imprint on the cushion breathed a sigh of relief as it inflated slightly. Fortunately I was already wearing gym kit as I wore gym kit most days anyway. I coughed, tied the laces and lumbered to the door. I crossed the threshold and put one foot in front of the other, I was now a runner.
