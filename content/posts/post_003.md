Rain trickled down the window and the patter of water on glass filled the study. Smoke rose from the single cigarette burning uselessly in the ash tray. The lights were off but John had not noticed, this had been the fourth night this week he'd been up late trying to solve this puzzle. How many minutes had he spent trying to write just a fourth digit down. It would not add up, numbers one through nine add up to forty-five, six boxes equal 270, he starting counting, 21, 46, 72, John lost count and threw the sudoku at the wall.
