Steam rose from the mug by the screen's side, packets of cereal bars covered the table, some even covering the numpad of the keyboard. A student sat at the desk, their head leaning into their hand, their elbow firmly pressed against the table. One headphone was in the right ear and the video of a lecture occupied their screen.
